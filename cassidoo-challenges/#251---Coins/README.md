# Coin amounts
From a set of coin values, find amd print the most efficient combination that adds up to a value.

## About
Done a week late due to finals, but completed all in one day. I started writing it in C, but then changed my mind and switched to Python, because Python Lists are easier than C Arrays. The assignment was to take a list of values of coins (such as `[1, 5, 10, 25]`) and return an array holding a combination of coins that add up to a total (such as `64`).

## Usage
`python coins.py [-t <total> -c <list of coins>]`

- There is a text interface if you do not include the optional arguments
- If you do include the optional arguments, make sure to include both `-c` *and* `-t`. Their order does not matter, though
