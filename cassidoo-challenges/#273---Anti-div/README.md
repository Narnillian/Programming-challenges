## About

Could have been completed in one day, if I didn't start it at 10PM right before bedtime. I barely had to do any work for this challenge, because the link above tells how to figure out if `k` is an anti-div of `n`.

## Usage

`python antidiv.py [number]` - Prints out anti-divisors of `number`.

`python -i antidiv.py` - Opens interactive Python prompt, from which you can run `antidivisor([number])` as was specified in the Newsletter.

Both options utilize the same function, which means that they print out the same result.
